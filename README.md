# System-Analysis-and-Design

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? 
Driver Pass is a company that provides driving training to people learning to drive. The owner of the company is the client. They are seeking to design a system that users can access online where they can purchase driving packages which include in-person driving practice with an instructor, and take online practice exams to prepare them for the driving test. They want the users to be able to make, modify, and cancel appointments. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I have taken the client's requirements into account and have worked well on including those requirements in the design. The system design should meet the client's needs for the system. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the UML Use Case diagram in the system design document. I think this diagram could be organized better and be made more consice and easier to read and follow. 

# How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing. 
I collected the client's requirements and organized them based on their level of importance. Organizing the requirements helps to break them down further into sections of the design. For example, breaking them down into each class they need to fall under. It is very important to consider the user and the client's needs when designing. The user is who will be using the system. They must be able to use the system how they intend to for it to be functional. The client's needs are important because this is their system and it should meet their requirements. If it does not meet their requirements, it could reflect poorly on the software design company. 

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The first step is to collect and analyze requirements set by the client. This way I get a good understanding of how the system should work. Next, I organize the system into classes and look at who the actors using the system are and what they should be able to do. This way, I can visualize each part of the system and have a plan for creating it.
